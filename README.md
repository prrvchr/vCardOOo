**Ce [document][2] en franÃ§ais.**

**The use of this software subjects you to our [Terms Of Use][3] and [Data Protection Policy][4].**

# version [1.0.0][5]

## Introduction:

**vCardOOo** is part of a [Suite][6] of [LibreOffice][7] ~~and/or [OpenOffice][8]~~ extensions allowing to offer you innovative services in these office suites.  
This extension gives you access, in LibreOffice, to your contacts present on a CardDAV server (or vCard Extensions to WebDAV).

Being free software I encourage you:
- To duplicate its [source code][9].
- To make changes, corrections, improvements.
- To open [issue][10] if needed.

In short, to participate in the development of this extension.  
Because it is together that we can make Free Software smarter.

## Requirement:

In order to take advantage of the latest versions of the Python libraries used in vCardOOo, version 2 of Python has been abandoned in favor of **Python 3.8 minimum**.  
This means that **vCardOOo no longer supports OpenOffice and LibreOffice 6.x on Windows since version 1.0.0**.
I can only advise you **to migrate to LibreOffice 7.x**.

vCardOOo uses a local [HsqlDB][12] database version 2.7.2.  
HsqlDB being a database written in Java, its use requires the [installation and configuration][13] in LibreOffice / OpenOffice of a **JRE version 11 or later**.  
I recommend [Adoptium][14] as your Java installation source.

If you are using **LibreOffice on Linux**, you are subject to [bug 139538][15]. To work around the problem, please **uninstall the packages** with commands:
- `sudo apt remove libreoffice-sdbc-hsqldb` (to uninstall the libreoffice-sdbc-hsqldb package)
- `sudo apt remove libhsqldb1.8.0-java` (to uninstall the libhsqldb1.8.0-java package)

If you still want to use the Embedded HsqlDB functionality provided by LibreOffice, then install the [HsqlDriverOOo][16] extension.

## Installation:

It seems important that the file was not renamed when it was downloaded.
If necessary, rename it before installing it.

## Has been tested with:

* LibreOffice 7.3.7.2 - Lubuntu 22.04 - Python version 3.10.12 - OpenJDK-11-JRE (amd64)

* LibreOffice 7.5.4.2(x86) - Windows 10 - Python version 3.8.16 - Adoptium JDK Hotspot 11.0.19 (under Lubuntu 22.04 / VirtualBox 6.1.38)

* LibreOffice 7.4.3.2(x64) - Windows 10(x64) - Python version 3.8.15  - Adoptium JDK Hotspot 11.0.17 (x64) (under Lubuntu 22.04 / VirtualBox 6.1.38)

* **Does not work with OpenOffice on Windows** see [bug 128569][11]. Having no solution, I encourage you to install **LibreOffice**.

I encourage you in case of problem :confused:  
to create an [issue][10]  
I will try to solve it :smile:

## Historical:

### Introduction:

This extension was written in order to make usable in free software (LibreOffice or OpenOffice) your personal data (your address book) stored in your Android phone.

With the [smtpMailerOOo][33] extension, it can be the data source for [mail merge][34] by email, to your correspondents contained in your phone.

It will give you access to an information system that only larges companies are able, today, to implement.

### What has been done for version 0.0.1:

- Writing of the UNO service [com.sun.star.sdbc.Driver][35] responding to the call from the url `sdbc:address:vcard:*`  
  The `connect(url, info)` method of this Driver use the [DataSource][36] singleton to return the UNO service `com.sun.star.sdbc.Connection`.

- This DataSource singleton is responsible for:

  - When created, create a [Replicator][37] thread to track remote changes on Nextcloud servers.
  - Create and cache a [User][38] Interface needed for:
    - Creating the connection to the underlying database.
    - Connect the Replicator to Nextcloud servers.
  - Start the Replicator each time you connect to the database.

-  After retrieving the remote modifications, the Replicator uses to analyze the content of the vCards a UNO `com.sun.star.task.Job` service [CardSync][39] written in Java and using the [ez-vcard][40] library.

### What remains to be done for version 0.0.1:

- Make the address book locally editable with replication of changes.

- Add new languages for internationalization...

- Anything welcome...
