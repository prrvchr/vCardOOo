**The use of this software subjects you to our** [**Terms Of Use**][3] **and** [**Data Protection Policy**][4]

# version [0.0.1][5]

## Introduction:

**vCardOOo** is part of a [Suite][6] of [LibreOffice][7] and/or [OpenOffice][8] extensions allowing to offer you innovative services in these office suites.  
This extension gives you access to your phone contacts in LibreOffice / OpenOffice (the contacts of your Android phone).

Being free software I encourage you:
- To duplicate its [source code][9].
- To make changes, corrections, improvements.
- To open [issue][10] if needed.

In short, to participate in the development of this extension.  
Because it is together that we can make Free Software smarter.

## Requirement:

vCardOOo uses a local [HsqlDB][11] database version 2.5.1.  
HsqlDB being a database written in Java, its use requires the [installation and configuration][12] in LibreOffice / OpenOffice of a **JRE version 11 or later**.  
I recommend [Adoptium][13] as your Java installation source.

If you are using **LibreOffice on Linux**, then you are subject to [bug 139538][14].  
To work around the problem, please uninstall the packages:
- libreoffice-sdbc-hsqldb
- libhsqldb1.8.0-java

If you still want to use the Embedded HsqlDB functionality provided by LibreOffice, then install the [HsqlDBembeddedOOo][15] extension.  
OpenOffice and LibreOffice on Windows are not subject to this malfunction.

## Installation:

It seems important that the file was not renamed when it was downloaded.
If necessary, rename it before installing it.

- Install ![OAuth2OOo logo][16] **[OAuth2OOo.oxt][17]** extension version 0.0.5.

You must install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install ![jdbcDriverOOo logo][18] **[jdbcDriverOOo.oxt][19]** extension version 0.0.4.

You must install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install ![vCardOOo logo][1] **[vCardOOo.oxt][20]** extension version 0.0.1.

Restart LibreOffice / OpenOffice after installation.

## Use:

In LibreOffice / OpenOffice go to File -> Wizards -> Address Data Source...:

## Has been tested with:

* LibreOffice 7.2.5.2 - Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS - LxQt 0.14.1

I encourage you in case of problem :-(  
to create an [issue][10]  
I will try to solve it ;-)

## Historical:

### Introduction:

This extension was written in order to make usable in free software (LibreOffice or OpenOffice) your personal data (your address book) stored in your Android phone.

With the [smtpMailerOOo][32] extension, it can be the data source for [mail merge][33] by email, to your correspondents contained in your phone.

It will give you access to an information system that only larges companies are able, today, to implement.

### What has been done for version 0.0.1:

- Writing of the UNO service [com.sun.star.sdbc.Driver][34] responding to the call from the url `sdbc:address:vcard:*`  
  The `connect(url, info)` method of this Driver use the [DataSource][35] singleton to return the UNO service `com.sun.star.sdbc.Connection`.

- This DataSource singleton is responsible for:

  - When created, create a [Replicator][36] thread to track remote changes on Nextcloud servers.
  - Create and cache a [User][37] Interface needed for:
    - Creating the connection to the underlying database.
    - Connect the Replicator to Nextcloud servers.
  - Start the Replicator each time you connect to the database.

-  After retrieving the remote modifications, the Replicator uses to analyze the content of the vCards a UNO `com.sun.star.task.Job` service [CardSync][38] written in Java and using the [ez-vcard][39] library.

### What remains to be done for version 0.0.1:

- Make the address book locally editable with replication of changes.

- Add new languages for internationalization...

- Anything welcome...
